# Cline Rules for Accessible Citizen Service Assistant

## Project Overview
This is the **Accessible Citizen Service Assistant** - an AI-powered universal access platform for accessible government communication (G7 GovAI Challenge - Statement 4).

## Core Principles

### 1. Accessibility First
- All features MUST meet WCAG 2.2 Level AAA standards
- Never compromise accessibility for aesthetics or convenience
- Test with actual assistive technologies (screen readers, voice control, etc.)
- Support multiple input/output modalities (voice, text, video, SMS)

### 2. Multilingual & Cultural Sensitivity
- Support 100+ languages with proper translation and localization
- Consider cultural context in all communication
- Avoid idioms, metaphors, or culturally-specific references unless localized
- Use plain language principles for all content

### 3. Inclusive Design
- Co-design with diverse users (disabilities, languages, ages, tech literacy)
- Never assume user capabilities or preferences
- Provide multiple ways to accomplish every task
- Respect user preferences (saved settings, adaptive UI)

### 4. Privacy & Security
- Minimize personal data collection
- Encrypt all sensitive information
- Clear consent mechanisms for data sharing
- Comply with GDPR, PIPEDA, and accessibility regulations

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use semantic HTML for accessibility
- Include ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum (7:1 for AAA)
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

### AI/ML Considerations
- Translation models must preserve meaning and context
- Voice recognition must handle diverse accents and speech patterns
- NLP must understand multiple languages and code-switching
- Bias testing for all AI models with diverse populations

### Documentation
- Document accessibility features and testing procedures
- Include examples for diverse user scenarios
- Maintain multilingual documentation
- Create user guides in plain language

## Technology Constraints
- **Frontend**: React with accessibility libraries (react-aria, radix-ui)
- **Backend**: FastAPI/Node.js with multilingual support
- **AI**: Gemini API for multilingual RAG, translation services
- **Testing**: Automated accessibility testing (axe, pa11y) + manual testing

## Key Features to Prioritize
1. Multi-modal interface (voice, text, video, SMS)
2. Real-time translation and localization
3. Document processing with accessibility
4. Form completion assistance
5. Communication drafting support
6. Accessibility adaptation system

## Testing Requirements
- Test with diverse users (various disabilities, languages, tech literacy)
- Validate WCAG AAA compliance
- Performance testing with assistive technologies
- User acceptance testing with actual citizens

## What NOT to Do
- Don't build features without accessibility from the start
- Don't assume English-only users
- Don't use complex language or jargon
- Don't implement features that require specific abilities (e.g., mouse-only)
- Don't store unnecessary personal information
- Don't skip user testing with diverse populations

## Success Criteria
- 100% WCAG AAA compliance
- >95% translation accuracy for pilot languages
- >80% completion rate for form assistance
- 4.5/5 average satisfaction rating
- 30% of users are from underserved populations
